CMS 484: Senior Capstone Group Project
Phase 0
Due: By beginning of class on Th. Feb. 2.
Submission: Submit .docx to BB (“Phase 0” assignment).  If you need to submit multiple documents, please make sure they are all attached to one submission.  Do not make multiple submissions (one for each document)!  Only one team member needs to submit. 
1.     List your team name and team members.
 Team Name: Rollins Valet Service
Team Members: Eddy Verde, Michael Gutensohn, Nick Benincasa, Chakib Cerny

2.     Give an approximately half-page narrative description of your project.  This should describe the problem you are trying to solve.  While you do not need to specify implementation details (yet), you should give some scope to your project.  I HIGHLY recommend that you start small.  It is easier to add more functionality to your project at a later date than it is to try to remove part of your project after development has begun.
 
There are many things Rollins College is notorious for, Cardigans, Chubbies, Students who’ve succumbed to affluenza, but what might be most notorious would be it’s absolutely horrendous parking. Whether you’re trying to park your BMW i8 in two spots to make sure that no one parks near you, or your just trying to make it to class on time. It’s a problem for everyone and a massive revenue stream for security. The location where this is most noticeable is the parking garage. Our goal is to address this problem by accurately tracking the availability of parking spots within the garage to allow drivers to know when parking is truly available, thus reducing the amount of time spent looking for a parking spot. Additionally, we’d also like to simplify and streamline the parking regulation enforcement process and reduce infractions.
 
3.     Discuss external product owner input.  Have you discussed your project with anyone outside the team?  Briefly comment on how you used (or didn’t use) their input.
 
Drivers: Location, Availability, When Is It Truly Full.
Rollins Project Manager (John Kanopck): Budget, Maintenance
 
4.     List any constraints or limitations of your project.  Are you excluding any functionality from your project at this time?  Give a brief justification of your exclusions.
 
Power, network links, scalability, and budget. We are limiting our scope to the garage and not including other obstructions and motorcycles. It is a good testing environment, with less variables such as weather in an open parking lot.
 
5.     Generate a list of user roles for your project, and give a brief (1-2 sentence) description of each.
 
For the users roles we selected Drivers, Security, and IT. The identified the driver and security as our main user roles since they will be using the system the most. We also added IT if this application does get funded by Rollins and starts to expand the IT will can maintain and expand the system.
 
6.     Generate a set of user stories for your project.  If you choose to do this using software or an online planning tool, you can submit a link to your site, you will need to have some way for me to view your stories. Send me an email if you plan to utilize this option.  (Alternately, you can submit a printout or screen grab of your user stories from the site/software.)  Include a tentative estimation of the time (in hours) to complete each user story.

7.     Select the user stories for your first sprint.  Write a justification about why you chose these stories and address what the “shippable state” of your project will be at the end of sprint 1, assuming your selected user stories are completed. 
	“As a Driver, I want to be able to see where I am allowed to park so that I don't get a ticket for parking on the wrong spot.”
	“As a Driver, I want to see if the parking lot is full so that I don't waste time searching for a spot.”
	“As a Driver, I want to be able to see whether or not a spot is available as I'm approaching it.”
	“As an IT tech, I want to have documentation so that I can understand every part of the code.”
 We chose these stories because they’re the most fundamental and necessary in order to complete all other stories. The shippable state will be one device that tracks three parking spots and indicates whether or not any of them or empty, occupied, or restricted.
8.     List the necessary skills and/or software which you will need to complete the first sprint.  Address which skills/software are already known to team members and which will need to be learned or acquired.
